# Getting started

- First thing first go to this [link](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and register yourself for hacktoberfest.

- Now if you already know about github and PR go on skip this step, otherwise visit these link [what is github](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/) and [how to create a pull request](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github)

- So now you have registered and learned about github and pr this is what you need to do. You need to submit 4 pull request to any open repository, even yours own repo will count, after your 4 repo wait for 7 days, its the time duration introduced by github this year to validate your pullrequests.

- Also before submitting any pull request to any repository check issues of that repo, this year hacktoberfest is blacklisting repository that just allow user to add its name and other detail and make a pr count.
 Example - [This repo](https://github.com/Dhroov7/Hacktoberfest2019) and it's [issue](https://github.com/Dhroov7/Hacktoberfest2019/issues/270)
